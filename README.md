# Finance Management Project

This is a finance management application with a **backend** service that handles authentication, user management, and a **dashboard** service for displaying financial data. The project uses **FastAPI** for the backend and **React** for the frontend, with **PostgreSQL** as the database.

## Setting Up the PostgreSQL Database

To set up the PostgreSQL database for this project, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites

- Make sure you have **PostgreSQL** installed locally.
- Ensure that you have access to a PostgreSQL user with sufficient privileges to create databases and users.
- Refer [Path to setup_db.sql](./FinanceManagement/backend/setup_db.sql) to set up DB. Change username and password and update [.env file](./FinanceManagement/backend/.env)
